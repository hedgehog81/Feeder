#Fish feeder

Hobby project I did to keep my fish alive while I was away.
The rig consisted of a perforated syringe that was filled with dry fish food.that was placed over a fish tank.
At predefined times the controller would rotate the syringe via a small servo an deposit food into the tank.
[Video of the rig in action](https://youtu.be/gjBpVbtTOGI)

The code was developed using AVR Studio but should compile whith standard avr-gcc.
No external libraries are used.
